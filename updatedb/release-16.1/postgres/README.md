Database update scripts for release 16.1 Postgres
=================================================

Introduction
------------

This directory contains a set of scripts to update the database for a
standard release 1.2.4 installation to release 16.1

The scripts can be run by sourcing the ./vars file in the transmart-data top directory
and then launching:

./run_all.sh

This will run scripts for each schema in sequence.

The scripts were generated by comparing a 1.2.4 and a 16.1 native
postgres database, applying changes until no further significant
differences were found.

If your installation has local additional changes we recoommend
reviewing the individual script to check for any conflicting chances.

For example, some scripts made certain database columns wider to
accommodate new public datasets. If you have already extended those
columns you may ned to keep your local (larger) column width.
