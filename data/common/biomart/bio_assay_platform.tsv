These proteins play key roles in mediating cell-cell, cell-tissue and cell-extracellular matrix interactions and are involved in the normal processes of cell growth, division, differentiation, migration, as well as apoptosis. These genes are also important in many diseases and pathophysiological processes, including tumor invasion and metastasis, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disorders, wound healing, inflammation, and some central nervous diseases.
